1. To begin, set your Git username and email using the following commands:
   - `git config user.name "{username}"`
   - `git config user.email "{email}"`

3. When creating a new branch, use one of the following naming conventions:
   - `feature/feature-name`
   - `bug/bug-details`
   - `design/design-details`

4. Format your commit messages as `Ticket number : Title` only. For example: `T-101 : Deploy site on production environment.`

5. Prior to committing, ensure you verify and resolve linting issues by running the following commands:

8. Customize the ESLint rules in the .eslintrc.cjs file to meet your project's specific requirements.
